I figured I should probably introduce myself properly, since it could be very difficult to actually get a feeling for what kind of person I am through the thousands of posts on my Twitter account.

My name is mostly irrelevant. My real name is Felix (I'm not revealing anything too crazy, I think the name is quite common). At least in Germany, where I live. My real name isn't really what I go by on most sites. That would be either Fistus or filx4034. The latter is simply the result of me smashing my head into my keyboard when creating my Twitter account and the website just automatically added the numbers.

Fistus has a bit of "lore":

1. Faust: There is an old German legend about a man named Faust, who leads a successful, but dissatisfied life, until he meets the devil at a crossroads. At that crossroads, Faust gives the devil his soul in exchange for infinite knowledge and earthly pleasures. Below is what happens when you type Faust into Google translate (I know you don't translate names, but Faust is a normal noun in German):

But where does the "us" at the end of Fistus come in? Simply put, I wasn't sure if the man from the tale was called Faust or Faustus. I think both versions exist. Since Faust would be Fist, Faustus would be Fistus.

2. The other reason why I started calling myself Fistus was to make people disgusted. When they would ask me about the origins of that name, I'd answer "Have you ever heard of fisting?".


That's a lot of talking about my name. Really, there isn't that much to me. My hobbies are limited to reading, watching anime, playing video games and playing around with interesting software. I don't really go outside, except for school (which won't start again until mid-August) and for one or two daily bicycle rides. I deemed them necessary, because I have a curved spine. Obviously, that causes me a lot of pain. I tend to sleep for 12â€“14 hours and rarely have more than one meal a day. Not eating anything the whole day is more common for me than eating two meals, to be honest.
