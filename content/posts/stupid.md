This may turn into a series, given how frequently I see stupid things on Twitter. Before I proceed, I should still say that my political views do not influence this, I am merely pointing out a major logical flaw in a person's arguments.

I just saw a post on Twitter that was very irritating to me. It didn't really make me that angry, but a little confused. I'll try to explain why this is.

# The post in question

{{< figure src="/images/dumb.jpg" class="center" >}}

Why do I find this so stupid? After all, I'm not American, I'm German, so there should be no reason for me to actually care. 

But there is a reason for me to care. The post is (indirectly) saying: 

>"All the things America has done are terrible. They were the bad guys in every single war they fought in."

I will admit that I'm not familiar with this person, but I feel comfortable with calling her "left-wing" (as far as the left-right spectrum actually works). If we assume the interpretation I just gave for the post's claim, we can extend the meaning of that post to say: 

>"Hitler should've won WWII."

Obviously, this person disagrees with that. The typical leftist will either start calling you a Nazi if you point this out to them or they will claim that the USSR won on their own. The first is a blatant attempt at discrediting dissent with emotional means, the second is simply untrue.
