I decided to make a website. Here, I will explain why I am doing this, what I used for this. Yeah, I think that's all. This "post" is very much just a test to see if it actually works.

# Why am I doing this?

When posting on [Twitter](https://x.com/filx4034), I often notice that my thoughts get way too long for the platform, so I recently started playing again with the idea of having my own website. Admittedly, I've had this idea fairly often, but this is the first time I'm actually doing it.

# What did I use for this?

I use [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), which makes this whole process very easy. My website is hosted on [Github pages](https://pages.github.com/). Lastly, I use a Hugo theme called [PaperMod](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/hugo-papermod/). Hugo is very nice, since you just write everything in Markdown (and TOML, but that's rare). Luckily, I have written a mediocre (at best) [Markdown reference guide](https://gitlab.com/filx4034/markdown-test). It's good enough.
